# what:
- This is sample code showing how to make requests to the Safaricom B2C/B2B Mpesa API.                              
- The code is provided mainly for documentation purposes and to server as inspiration(or not) for your own code.         
- Please note, that the code may not work as is.
- Also note that these code may be stale. As a point of note, Safaricom has since the publication of this repo come out with what I hear is a better API than what the previous one(which this code sample was based on).
